    <img src="assests/china flag.jpg" alt="chinese flag">
    <p>Claims have come out from the leaks and the uprising. These claims have shown that China has been in control of North Korea for over
    100 years. They use it as a ploy, they want to control and strike fear into the eyes of other countries but don't want embargo's on China so
    they use North Korea as their face when trying to incite war and fear.</p>

<h1>Putin and the Russian Government
  are now broke due to the uprising</h1>
<img src="assests/russian flag.jpg" alt="russian flag">
  <p> Vladimir Putin has never been the most liked person in the Government position. It is definitely true now with the uprising around the world
  and especially in Russia. No one in Russia is working, therefor Russia has lost it's income and is struggling to figure out what to do. He does
not want to step down because that is weak so they are currently looking for other solutions. IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.</p>

<div class="laststory">
<h1>The United States may be the only savior to all of this uprising</h1>
<img src="assests/usflag.jpg" alt="U.S. flag">
<p>The United States of America seem to be doing okay because no one wants to rebel and lose their source of money. Also the work force thinks This
will be good for the economy because we have the only working work force. America is good, not looking to be the worlds police anymore. The President
has said "let the other countries fend for themselves for once." Every American agreed.</p>
